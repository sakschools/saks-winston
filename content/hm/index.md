## Mr. Lubogo Steven – Head Teacher

Welcome to Winston Day and Boarding Primary School Kawempe , a distinguished centre of academic excellence and character formation nestled in the heart of Uganda. At Winston, we are passionately committed to providing holistic, high-quality primary education that not only meets but consistently exceeds national standards. Our pupils continually shine in the Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE), a clear reflection of our dedicated staff, effective teaching methodologies, and the nurturing learning environment we have cultivated.

Education at Winston is not limited to academic performance alone. We take great pride in offering a well-rounded curriculum that nurtures every aspect of a child’s development. Alongside strong academics, we run a robust Talent Development Programme, where pupils are trained in swimming, ball games, debate, home economics, chess, and the performing arts. These activities enhance creativity, discipline, teamwork, physical fitness, and critical thinking, skills that prepare learners for success both in school and beyond.

To support the formation of responsible, respectful, and morally upright individuals, Winston has instituted a structured Behaviour Building Programme. Through this initiative, pupils are guided in developing good manners, leadership qualities, empathy, emotional intelligence, and respect for authority. Discipline is positively enforced, and every learner is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and to strive for personal excellence in both word and deed.

We are proudly multi-denominational, embracing Uganda’s beautiful religious diversity. Each week, time is allocated for faith-based instruction, where Christian pupils receive dedicated lessons in Christian values and biblical teachings, while Muslim pupils engage in Islamic theology and Quranic studies. In addition, we host special spiritual milestones such as Holy Communion, Confirmation ceremonies, and Islamic celebrations, all conducted respectfully within the school environment. This commitment to spiritual growth ensures that learners are grounded in values, faith, and moral clarity.

At Winston, we believe in nurturing the whole child. Our enriched curriculum blends academic achievement with character formation, creativity with discipline, and spiritual grounding with real-world readiness. We offer a safe, inclusive, and loving environment where each child’s potential is not only discovered but actively sharpened and celebrated.

We would be deeply honoured to welcome your child into the Winston family. Join us on this transformative journey — one marked by academic brilliance, personal growth, spiritual grounding, and a lifelong love for learning.
