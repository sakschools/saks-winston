# HEAD PREFECT’S MESSAGE

I am Acheng Karen Daniels, the current President of the Pupils’ Leadership Body at Winston Day and Boarding Primary School – Kawempe. I am honoured to lead a dedicated team of prefects who actively support the smooth running of our school. Together, we work hand in hand with the administration and staff to promote discipline, uphold school values, and ensure that every pupil thrives in a well-managed learning environment.

Our primary focus is academics. We closely collaborate with our teachers to ensure that the academic routine is followed consistently and effectively. We monitor activities such as morning work, which keeps early arrivals engaged in productive learning, and lunch-hour reviews that reinforce previously covered content. We believe that a strong academic culture lays the foundation for excellence, and we are committed to maintaining it.

Beyond academics, we also prioritise the general welfare of our fellow pupils. One of our key responsibilities is overseeing the school meals—from storage, through preparation, to serving. Our major concern is the quality and quantity of the food provided. We strive to ensure that every pupil receives a nutritious and satisfying meal that contributes to their overall well-being and ability to concentrate in class.

Sanitation and hygiene are also high on our list of priorities. We understand that a clean environment promotes good health and effective learning. As such, we frequently inspect the kitchen, utensils, classrooms, toilets, and the school compound to ensure cleanliness is maintained. A healthy learning environment fosters comfort, safety, and productivity for all pupils.

We are deeply grateful to our Directors and School Management for establishing Winston Day and Boarding Primary School on values that accommodate all religious denominations. This inclusive approach allows us to grow not only academically but also spiritually. By the time we leave the primary level, we are well-prepared to face the world as morally upright and religiously aware individuals.

I warmly encourage every parent and guardian to consider enrolling their child at Winston Day and Boarding Primary School – Kawempe. With our strong academic program, commitment to discipline, emphasis on spiritual growth, talent development through co-curricular activities, and focus on pupil welfare, your child is guaranteed a solid foundation and a path towards a first grade.
